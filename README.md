# Python Data Cleaning â€“ Telco Churn Dataset

In this project, I cleaned and prepared the Telco Churn dataset using Python and Pandas.  
Steps included handling missing data, removing unnecessary columns, fixing data types, and saving the cleaned dataset.  
It was part of my Data Analytics portfolio to showcase practical data wrangling skills.
